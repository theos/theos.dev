Theos was initially 'iphone-framework', a project created to simplify building code at the command line, primarily for jailbroken iOS devices. It later underwent significant changes and became Theos, a flexible [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-based build system targeting jailbreak software development, but also with complete support for building for various other platforms. Theos runs on, and can build projects for, macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows.

In 2015, the project stalled as Dustin Howett was unable to devote time to it. Since then, it has been taken up by [the community](https://github.com/theos/theos/graphs/contributors) who have added a host of desired features and fixed numerous issues. The original (now legacy) version of Theos that used to be located at DHowett/theos is now permanently preserved on the [legacy](https://github.com/theos/theos/tree/legacy) branch.

Documentation for legacy Theos is available on the [iPhone Dev Wiki](http://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/Theos) and at [theos-ref](https://github.com/theiostream/theos-ref).
