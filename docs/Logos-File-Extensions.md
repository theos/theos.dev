| Extension | Process order |
|-----------|---------------|
| .x        | will be processed by Logos, then preprocessed and compiled as Objective-C.   |
| .xm       | will be processed by Logos, then preprocessed and compiled as Objective-C++. |
| .xi       | will be preprocessed first, then Logos will process the result, and then it will be compiled as Objective-C.   |
| .xmi      | will be preprocessed first, then Logos will process the result, and then it will be compiled as Objective-C++. |

.xi or .xmi files enable Logos directives to be used in preprocessor macros, such as `#define`. You can also import other Logos source files with the `#include` statement. However, this is discouraged, since this leads to longer build times recompiling code that hasnâ€™t changed. Separating into .x and .xm files, sharing variables and functions via `extern` declarations, is recommended.

These file extensions control how a build system such as Theos should build a Logos file. Logos itself does not take the file extension into account and works regardless of whether a file is Objective-C or Objective-C++.
