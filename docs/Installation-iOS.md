	* iOS >= 12.0
		* [Procursus](https://apt.procurs.us/) or [Sam Bingnerâ€™s repo](https://apt.bingner.com/) (this depends on the jailbreak you are using)
	* iOS < 12.0
		* [Coolstar's repo](https://coolstar.org/publicrepo/), [Sam Bingner's repo](https://repo.bingner.com/), and [BigBoss](http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/)

1. Install the following prerequisites<sup>1</sup> as *root*:
