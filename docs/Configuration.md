title: Configuration

Theos, and your project(s), can be configured in a few differents ways:
- At runtime
- At buildtime via project Makefiles
- At buildtime by passing variables to `make`

## `.theosrc`

Variables that are specific to your own setup (e.g., Xcode/an SDK, device IP, etc) should not be placed in your project makefile as it may hinder others from building your project. Instead, these variables should be placed in `.theosrc`, a makefile that is read and executed during an early stage of Theosâ€™ `common.mk`.

`.theosrc` is used to configure Theos at runtime and must be created by the user at `$HOME/.theosrc` or `~/.theosrc`.

## Utilizing Theos' makefile rules

Makefile rules are defined as:
```Makefile
targets: prerequisites
	command
	command
```

Theos utilizes a variety of such rules internally, many of which can also be utilized by users by adding the following to your project's Makefile:
```Makefile
rule-name::
	your_command
	your_command
```

Such rule names include:
- before-clean
- internal-clean
- after-clean
- before-all
- internal-all
- after-all
- before-stage
- internal-stage
- after-stage
- before-package
- internal-package
- after-package
- before-$(THEOS_CURRENT_INSTANCE)-all
- after-$(THEOS_CURRENT_INSTANCE)-all
- internal-$(_THEOS_CURRENT_TYPE)-all

## Utilizing Theos' message commands

Theos utilizes a variety of custom `echo` and `printf` commands which it defines as variables in $THEOS_MAKE_PATH/messages.mk. These can be utilized by users in their own project makefiles if so desired.

Such variables include:
- $(ECHO_BEGIN)
    - Defines start of command users wants printed after running

- $(ECHO_NOTHING)
    - Defines start of command users wants printed after running
        - Note that when verbosity is enabled, `set -o pipefail` is run beforehand

- $(ECHO_END)
    - Defines end of command user wrapped in $(ECHO_BEGIN) or $(ECHO_NOTHNG)

- $(STDERR_NULL_REDIRECT)
    - Defined as `2> /dev/null`
        - Disabled if verbosity is enabled

- $(STDOUT_NULL_REDIRECT)
    - Defined as `> /dev/null`
        - Disabled if verbosity is enabled

- $(PRINT_FORMAT)
    - Defined as `printf "\e[0;36m==> \e[1;36mNotice:\e[m %s\n"`

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_WARNING)
    - Defined as `printf "\e[0;33m==> \e[1;33mWarning:\e[m %s\n"`

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_ERROR)
    - Defined as `printf "\e[0;31m==> \e[1;31mError:\e[m %s\n"`

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_RED)
    - Color a print statement red
        - Disabled if COLOR=0

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_GREEN)
    - Disabled if COLOR=0

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_YELLOW)
    - Disabled if COLOR=0

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_BLUE)
    - Disabled if COLOR=0

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_MAGENTA)
    - Disabled if COLOR=0

- $(PRINT_FORMAT_CYAN)
    - Disabled if COLOR=0

## Utilizing GNU Make

Theos relies on `make` (ideally GNU Make) to function. This means that all standard make capabilities can be used with Theos as if they were being used in any standard makefile.

These capabilities include:
- Print formatting
- Running commands
- File acquisition via wildcards
- Setting variables to varying degrees of project depth
- Utilizing conditional statements

### Print formatting

The following can be used in your makefile(s) as desired within Theos' makefile rules:

- $(info some text here)
    - Will print `some text here`

- $(warning some text here)
    - Will print `Makefile:<line#>: some text here`

- $(error some text here)
    - Will print `Makefile:<line#>: *** some text here.  Stop.`
    - Note: will stop the build

- @echo "some text here"
    - Will print `some text here`

- @printf "some text here"
    - Will print `some text here` without a trailing newline (i.e. \n)

### Running commands

If you need to run commands from within a makefile, there are two main ways:

- $(shell command)
    - Will return the output of "command" for use
- Typing the command as-is
    - Will print both the command being run and the output, if relevant

Note that these will have to be under a rule in order to run.

### File acquisition via wildcards

For your project instance (where XXX = project_name), the XXX_FILES variable is required for non-null project types. If your project has a large number of files and/or a complex directory structure, typing out each file by hand would be unnecessarily arduous. To work around this, makefile's have wildcards. The syntax is as follows:

```Makefile
$(wildcard pattern-to-match)
```

An example of this would be
```Makefile
XXX_FILES = $(wildcard *.m) $(wildcard files/*.x)
```

Assuming you have a complex directory structure and don't feel like messing with pattern-matching, you can also shell out to `find`.

An example of this would be
```Makefile
XXX_FILES = $(shell find -type f -name "*.m")
```

### Setting variables to varying degrees of project depth

In order to configure your project, you will almost certainly be modifying variables in your project's makefile(s).

Variables can be kept local to their project's instance by declaring them normally.

An example of this would be
```Makefile
ARCHS = arm64 arm64e
```

If you want a variable to apply to all instances within a project (i.e. apply to subprojects), then you can preface the variable declaration with `export`.

An example of this would be
```Makefile
export TARGET = iphone:clang:latest:12.0
```

### Utilizing conditional statements

Whether you're declaring variables yourself or modifying predefined ones, conditional statements can come in handy for complex configuration.

Makefile `if` statements following the syntax:

```Makefile
ifeq($(variable),$(variable-to-check-against))
    something=0
else ifneq($(variable2),$(variable-to-check-against))
    something=1
else ifdef($(variable3))
    something=2
else ifndef($(variable4))
    something=3
else
    something=4
endif
```
